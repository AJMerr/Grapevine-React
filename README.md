# Grapevine

# Brief Overview
Grapevine was a project I created while attending General Assembly at the end of 2019. The original project was created using Handlebars for a front end framework, and I decided that I'd like to modernize the Front End by using React. I decided to re-create this project as it originally was, adding full CRUD functionality. The though behind Grapevine was to create an anonymous messaging application. Users will be able to post messages 100% anonymously without worry of being exposed. This provides an outlet to those that need to get thoughts or feelings off their chest without worry of judgement.
